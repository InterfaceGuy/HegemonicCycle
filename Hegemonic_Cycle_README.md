# Hegemonic Cycle

The Hegemonic cycle, also known as the Long Cycle of Global Politics, is a 100-year cycle in global power dynamics. Developed by George Modelski, this theory suggests that world politics has been dominated by a succession of global powers. The cycle typically includes:

1. Global War
2. World Power
3. Delegitimation
4. Deconcentration

Examples of hegemonic powers in recent centuries:

- Portugal (15th-16th centuries)
- Netherlands (16th-17th centuries)
- United Kingdom (18th-19th centuries)
- United States (20th-21st centuries)

Each hegemon has contributed to the evolution of the global system, often through technological and organizational innovations. The theory suggests that as one power declines, a period of global conflict ensues before a new hegemon emerges. This cycle provides insights into long-term patterns of international relations and global governance.
